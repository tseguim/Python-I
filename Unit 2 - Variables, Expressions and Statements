Exercise 5
The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given...

Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of $10000 to variable P, assign to n the value 12, and assign to r the interest rate of 8%.  
Then have the program prompt the user for the number of year t that the money will be compounded for.  Calculate and print the final amount after t years.

Exercise 6
Evaluate the following numerical expressions in your head, then use the Python interpreter to check your results:
- 5 % 2
- 9 % 5
- 15 % 12
- 12 % 15
- 6 % 6
- 0 % 7
- 7 % 0

"""
Exercise 8
Write a program to solve the general version of the above problem.  Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and ask for the number of hours to wait.  Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.
