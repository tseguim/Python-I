Your assigment will be to draw a regular polygon givent the user's input

"""

# import the appropriate package or packages

# Instantiate your turtle 
# Here you can add any color, and pensize that you would like

# Instantiate your window
# Here you can pick the color for your window

numSides = # your number of sides input is stored in the numSides variable 

# calculate the angle that your turtle will have to turn right or 
# left to create the polygon
# you will have to think about how to calculate these angles

angle = # your calculation is stored in this variable here

# create a for loop that will move the number of sides 

for i in range(numSides):
  # move the turtle forward whatever side size you pick
  # move the turtle left or right with the angle you calculated above
  # .right(angle) OR .left(angle)
